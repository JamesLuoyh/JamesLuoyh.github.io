Hi, there!

I’m Yuhong Luo, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Recently, I am working with [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/) on learning fair representations with high-confidence guarantees.

Overall, my research interest is in AI fairness and robustness. Particularly, I am interested in analyzing modern ML systems and exploring opportunities to enhance the worst-group performance under distributional shifts or adversarial attacks, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. I am also interested in learning and improving efficient and effective data mining algorithms for social science.

You can reach me at yuhongluo@umass.edu.
