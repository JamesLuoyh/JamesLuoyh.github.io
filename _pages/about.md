Hi, there!

I’m Yuhong Luo, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Currently, I am working with [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/) on providing machine learning algorithms with high-confidence fairness guarantees.

Overall, my research interest is in AI fairness and robustness. Particularly, I am interested in analyzing modern ML systems from both the algorithmic and statistical perspectives, and exploring opportunities to improve worst-case performance. I am also interested in applying and creating efficient data mining algorithms for social computing.

You can reach me at yuhongluo@umass.edu.
