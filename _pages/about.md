Hi, there!

Iâ€™m Yuhong Luo, a PhD student in Computer Science at Rutgers.

Currently, I am working with [Xintong Wang](https://xintongemilywang.github.io/) on AI and Economics. Overall, my research interest is in AI robustness and trustworthiness. Particularly, I am interested in analyzing modern ML systems (e.g., LLMs) from both the algorithmic and statistical perspectives.

Before Rutgers, I was a Master's student at UMass, working with [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/) on providing machine learning algorithms with high-confidence fairness guarantees and with [Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home) on scalable and prediction temporal graph representation learning.

You can reach me at y.luo@rutgers.edu.
